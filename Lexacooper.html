										<h1>Journey from being abused to Ted Conferences</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/happy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Many people believe that overcoming abuse entails leaving the abuser. However, leaving does not instantly alleviate the suffering and pain. Removing yourself from an abusive situation is a crucial first step, but it's only the beginning. There are no hard and fast rules for rediscovering life's pleasures. However, you must take actions to heal on your own schedule.</p>
									<p>The first step is to admit that there was abuse (or exists). That is something that far too many people fail to do. They persuade themselves that they have done something wrong to deserve to be attacked. Abusers are usually quite good at making their victims feel like this.</p>
									<p>I avoided looking in the mirror for years thereafter because I couldn't face the lady who stared back at me. I didn't care for her. I didn't care for her. I had never heard of her before. I couldn't understand how my father's child, who had been raised to be brave, strong, proud, and intelligent, had become a punching bag for some man.</p>
                                    <p>With the passage of time, I realised that unless I forgave myself, I would never be able to move on from my setback. If I didn't admit that I was being abused and that I didn't ask for it, I'd sink deeper into depression than I already was. I had to go back to when I was four years old and hear my parents tell me that I was destined for greatness.I needed to return to a time when people paid attention to and appreciated my voice and thoughts. I had to remind myself that I was once joyful and enjoyed being alive. I simply had to acknowledge that someone who claimed to love me had attacked me, and I would no longer be obedient to the agony.Today I am giving my first Ted Talk</p>
                                    <p>Healing is the final step, and it is frequently overlooked. Healing from a long-term abusive partner, in my opinion, necessitates complete and total focus on oneself. It necessitates ongoing awareness of your current position in the process.</p>
