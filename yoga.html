                                        The term "yoga" stands for "union." It is a philosophical science seeking unity of an individual's soul with absolute reality. 
                                        Yoga has its origin from the ancient times. It is an integration of mind, body, and soul. Besides, mindfulness emphasizes 
                                        focused awareness and accepting the internal experiences without being judgemental. 
                                        These techniques offer a trending new dimension of treatment in various mental disorders.
                                        Meditation helps bring a person into the present moment and allows them to clear their minds. 
                                        Controlled, focused movements also help strengthen the body-mind connection. 
                                        Breathing exercises are effective in reducing depressive symptoms.
                                        yoga therapy can help with stress, anxiety, and depression. Yoga is a gentle exercise that incorporates both
                                        meditation and controlled, physical movements. The focus on deep breathing and 
                                        stretching your body is effective for relieving the symptoms of depression, such as sleep troubles, pain, and a loss of energy.
                                        “Like meditation, controlling your thoughts and emotions through your body is a powerful experience that is the
                                        opposite of depression and anxiety. Being able to be the master of your own mind is the opposite of bipolar disorder when
                                        you feel out of control. Yoga teaches you strategies of self-control,” said Dr. Soroya Bacchus, a psychiatrist who practices in California.

                                        The goal of mental health therapy is to restore psychological balance if it has been disrupted. 
                                        Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, is a way to help people with a broad variety of mental illnesses and emotional difficulties. 
                                        Psychotherapy can help eliminate or control troubling symptoms so a person can function better and can increase well-being and healing.
                                        Therapy may be conducted in an individual, family, couple, or group setting, and can help both children and adults.
                                        Both patient and therapist need to be actively involved in psychotherapy. 
                                        The trust and relationship between a person and his/her therapist is essential to working together effectively and 
                                        benefiting from psychotherapy.
                                        behavioral therapies classified mood disorders, such as depression, as cognitive disorders that could be clinically 
                                        treated with a combination of emotional, behavioral and cognitive components.
                                        Behavioral therapies generally involve three different cognition aspects including Automatic thoughts,
                                        distortions in thinking, and underlying beliefs.
